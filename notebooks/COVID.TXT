The origin of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, remains a subject of investigation and debate. The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, with many early cases linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, suggesting a zoonotic spillover. The prevailing theory is that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and possibly spread to humans via an intermediate host such as pangolins, supported by significant genetic similarities with bat coronaviruses. However, the lab leak theory, proposing that the virus accidentally escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, has also been considered, although there is no conclusive evidence to support this hypothesis. Ongoing research aims to clarify the exact origins of the virus to better understand and prevent future pandemics.
